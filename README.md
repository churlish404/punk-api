# Punk API Beer Finder

## Overview
The project is a beer catalogue allowing you to search your favourite beers from the Punk API https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2.
I used React/Typescript/Vite to build the app and deployed it using GH Pages on https://churlish404.github.io/punk-api. Please follow the instructions below to run the program locally.

## Run

+ `git clone "https://github.com/churlish404/punk-api.git"`
+ `npm install` installs dependencies
+ `npm run dev` will open the development server
